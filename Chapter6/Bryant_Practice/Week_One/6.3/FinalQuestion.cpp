card. To qualify, the person must have worked on his or her current job for at least
two years and make at least $17,000 per year. Finish the program by writing the
definitions of the functions qualify and noQualify. The function qualify should
explain that the applicant qualifies for the card and that the annual interest rate is
12 percent. The function noQualify should explain that the applicant does not
qualify for the card and give a general explanation why.*/
