Tests:
There will be 3 tests worth 60% of the total grade, altogether. 
The tests will be given on the dates specified and there are no make-up tests for any reason. If you miss a test due to a verifiable illness or emergency, its points will be transferred to the other two tests. 
Tests are given at the start of the period - 1:00 PM - and end all at the same time.
Tests are programs you must write and submit in class much like assignments.  You may use any printed or online material including your notes and assignments.
You must be present in class to take the tests.  


Projects:
Lab projects constitute 40% of the total grade. 
The due date of each project, number of points each is woth and what to do is posted on this Web site under Tasks, Tests and Surveys. 
You must submit your assignments to the class Web site only. No emails will be accepted.  Any assignment submitted via email will simply be deleted without a reply.  
For each project, you need both the cpp and exe files.  Be careful not to submit blank pages as you cannot resubmit an assignment that has already been submitted even if it's a blank page.  
 To do your homework at home, you will need to install Microsoft Visual Studio 2005 Express which comes with your textbook on your computer; otherwise, you may use the computers in BJ103, BJ105 or the LAIR.  Check with the lab attendant or posted hours for each lab.  You may also use Visual Studio 2005 Standard or Visual Studio 2008 both of which are also on lab computers.
When using campus computers, you can save your work on the U: drive, but it's best to save on your USB storage device so you can take it with you. You may also email it to yourself as an attachment.  Anything you save on the C: drive of campus computers get purged when you shut down or reset the computer, so stay away from the C: drive of campus computers including My Documents, Desktop, or other folders.  Obviously, this applies only to campus computers.
You are encouraged to help each other, but if you simply copy someone else's work, both students will receive an F for the class and both will be reported to the Dean for further disciplinary action. 
Each project has a strict deadline with a limited grace period. Submitting after the deadline and within the grace period will cause you to lose 20%.  After the grace period, you will not be able to submit. There are no exceptions.
Do not wait until the last day to start on an assignment.  If you do and you run into problems such as Internet connection problems, or Web site problems, or computer problems or whatever other problem and as a result you miss the deadline, it is your problem. 
If you have to miss a deadline due to a medical emergency, send me an email and then bring me the proof.  I will notify you via email whether you can submit late or not.
Schedules and policies are subject to change. Check the Web site frequently for announcements and changes.  

 Withdrawal from Class:
 If you decide to drop the class, do it officially before the deadline to avoid receiving an F.
